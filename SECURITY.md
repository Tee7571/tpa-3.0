# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We take security vulerabilities very seriously. As such, we have developed a policy on how to handle such. 

1: **privately report vulerabitilies.**
Publicily stating vulerabilities can impact the security of ScriptOS and ScriptOS Sub-syste immensely, and can cause "System Security Breach" S-Alert and/or 
temporary shutdown of ScriptOS.

2: **Discloser**
After you have **privately** disclosed the vulerability, be as detailed as possible when sending me a vulerability report. Being vagae in your explanation can lead
more damage then if you didn't report at all.
